1 Project Proposal

For our final project, we will be recreating a “Wii-Sports” version of “Pong”. Specifically, we will create a game of virtual pong in which two users can play with physical paddles. The paddles will contain accelerometers which we will read the input of to interact with the paddles and balls on the pong screen.

Below is a list of the main materials we needed.

1 Monitor for Game Display
Acrylic or 3-D Printer Filament for Paddle Casings
Two Accelerometers
1 Raspberry Pi

Connie will focus on the paddle functionality. Specifically, she will learn how to read inputs from the accelerometer, process them, and input them into the program such that they can “interact” with the on-screen paddles and balls.

Iddah will focus on the animation of the game. She will learn how to implement the Bouncing Ball algorithm to create a realistic animation of the ball, and also learn how to have the ball interact with the moving paddles. 

We will work together to combine the input-functionality (Connie) to interfacing with the graphics of the game (Iddah).

Our Project Milestones are as follows: 

Milestone 1: 
Have simple animations displayed: the ball should be bouncing independently, and the paddles should be able to move horizontally across the screen (without any external input).
Have the Raspberry Pi read input values from the accelerometers. (Just pure numbers, no processing of read values).

[Midpoint] Milestone 2:
Have the read values from the accelerometer control the motion of the paddles on the screen.

Milestone 3: 
Have the paddle inputs control the paddle motion on screen.
3-D print or laser cut a paddle casing for the accelerometer.

[Final] Milestone 4:
Have the ball bounce according to the paddle movement.
Be able to determine the duration/winner of the game.

Once obtaining these final milestones, we will have released a complete version of our final project!

Needed Resources

Our project lies in two fields: hardware to interface with and read paddle input. Thus, we will require resources on how to read analog inputs from the accelerometer, and send them to the Raspberry Pi for further computations.

We are also interested in learning the algorithms behind displaying certain types of graphics, in this case, mainly the bouncing ball.
